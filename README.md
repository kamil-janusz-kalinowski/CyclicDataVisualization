# CyclicDataVisualization


Repository contains Python and MATLAB code for coloring optical vortex and optical fork images using both standard colormap and cyclic map. It aims to demonstrate the enhanced readability of cyclic maps in visualizing data such as angles, days of the week, moon phases, and seasons.



The code also includes functionality for animating images, further highlighting the advantages of cyclic colormaps.

In the MATLAB code, cyclic colormap available at https://www.fabiocrameri.ch/cycliccolourmaps/ has been utilized.
